- Added preliminary support for specifying a timeout parameter for DNS measurements

* Mon Oct 5 2015 RIPE Atlas Team <atlas@ripe.net> - 4720
- The method for measuring times (e.g. RTTs) for each measurement has been switched to use a strictly monotonic, relative clock, thereby avoiding the artefacts caused by absolute clock changes due to time synchronisation.
- The RDATA field of a DNS measurement result (in response to a TXT query) is now a list of strings. It was a single string before.
- The cipher list supported by SSL/TLS certificate checks have been refreshed.
- Fixed a bug where one-off results were reported multiple times in some cases.
- Fixed a issue where NTP measurements could generate syntactically incorrect results which, as a consequence, were never stored.
- Fixed an issue where IPv6-only probes did not properly report their network configuration.
- Fixed a bug where failed DNS measurements in some cases did not report the time of measurement.
- The probes, in addition to the infrastructure, now also enforce the restriction that local (RFC1918 and link-local) addresses should not be measured.
- When removing static configuration from a probe, the statically added previous DNS server was still used

* Mon Jul 6 2015 RIPE Atlas Team <atlas@ripe.net> - 4700
- This is mostly a maintenance release, with internal behavioural changes only.

* Sat Mar 28 2015 RIPE Atlas Team <atlas@ripe.net> - 4680
- This firmware incorporates a few bug fixes:
- If probe has statically configured nameserver and also DHCPv4, the DHCP one wins, thereby fixing stale DNS entries
- Enhance the NTP client on v3 probes
- V3 probes now pick up IPv6 DNS resolvers from RA messages
- Stability issues on v1/v2 probes when HTTP measurements immediately fail with connection errors
- "SSLCert" measurements now also support TLS

- Fixed bug in DNS where RA flag was set in requests

* Mon Mar 17 2014 RIPE Atlas Team <atlas@ripe.net> - 4610
- The new firmware fixes a few DNS related bugs:
- In some cases the probe sent DNS results too often
- Querying the local DNS resolver could result in multiple results (one per resolver), but these could not be accessed in the data store. The new version collects results from all resolvers into one data structure. See the /apis/result-format/#version-4610-dns-lookup for details.
- In addition, this firmware adds preliminary support for using IPv6 extension headers. This will be available in the UI and in the API at a later date.

* Mon Feb 17 2014 RIPE Atlas Team <atlas@ripe.net> - 4600
- The new firmware release (4600) contains bug fixes for missing fields in ping results (TTL and source address). It also incorporates a more secure way for the probes to authenticate new firmwares before upgrading.

* Mon Dec 16 2013 RIPE Atlas Team <atlas@ripe.net> - 4580
- Due to an issue with the latest firmware release, a subset of the v3 probes were listening to incoming connections on an open port that should not have been left open. As a secondary measure, however, access to this port required credentials only available to the RIPE Atlas probe developers. It therefore never presented open access to the probes. This port (SSH) is used for development purposes in our internal development environment.
- We upgraded the v3 probes to a new, corrected firmware version (4580), and improved the checks in our firmware release process. The new firmware is otherwise functionally equivalent to the previous one.
- This issue did not affect version 1/2 probes and anchors.

* Thu Nov 21 2013 RIPE Atlas Team <atlas@ripe.net> - 4570
- Upgrade kernel on v3 probes without losing static network config
- Uniform interpretation of the size parameter of ping and traceroute: the size excludes the IPv4/IPv6 header and the transport (ICMP, TCP, UDP) header
- Add TCP mode to traceroute measurements
- Most measurements (except for DNS "use probe's local resolvers") now pick up a new list of resolvers if it has been updated by DHCP
- Support for SRV and NAPTR in DNS measurements
- Support "number of retries" option in DNS measurements
- Note that the use of the new measurement flag will be enabled in the UI and API at a later stage.

* Tue Apr 23 2013 RIPE Atlas Team <atlas@ripe.net> - 4520
- This is a bug fix release for all probe architectures. There is a small bug in the probe measurement code that can be trigger only if a controller sends the wrong commands to a probe.

* Tue Apr 23 2013 RIPE Atlas Team <atlas@ripe.net> - 4510
- Version 3 probes
  - Fixes for static network configuration
- Anchor
  - Cleanup in anchor package
  - Various fixes to the startup/shutdown scripts
  - Aligned build script with upstart for killing processes
  - Clean up pid files on Atlas shutdown
  - Kill Atlas processes on install/uninstall
  - Anchor now requires daemontools to be installed

* Thu Feb 28 2013 RIPE Atlas Team <atlas@ripe.net> - 4500
- RIPE Atlas probe software now supports two more architectures: TP-Link (for the next generation probes) and CentOS (for RIPE Atlas anchors).
- There is now support for one-off measurements for ping, traceroute, DNS, and HTTPget.
- We fixed a bug in DNS measurements in which, when querying local resolvers, more queries went to the last resolver.
- Fixed "error" : { "TUCONNECT" : "Success"}. Before this version DNS TCP and HTTPget reported an error message "Success".
- First release of anchor package

* Wed Oct 3 2012 RIPE Atlas Team <atlas@ripe.net> - 4480
- Fixed bug in traceroute when it has to deal with rfc4884 objects (mpls) that have a wrong size.
- Delayed DNS name resolution in ping and traceroute. This feature will soon be enabled through the UI.
- Fixed bug in HTTP GET where some characters where not properly escaped in generating the result JSON.
- Fixed bugs in the libevent stub resolver to better handle DNS errors and timeouts (affects mostly httpget)
- Limit the amount of measurement data that is sent as one unit. This prevents probes that have not connected to a controller for some time from overloading the controller.
- The probe uptime is now in the DNS SOS messages that are sent by probes before they try to connect. This will allow making a distinction between various reasons for disconnects: e.g. probe reboot vs. network problems.
- Initial version for anchor package added (Anand Buddhev)

* Thu Sep 20 2012 RIPE Atlas Team <atlas@ripe.net> - 4470
- This firmware fixes two bugs.
  - The first one is that DNS results may get mixed up when a probe runs two DNS measurements at the same time.
  - The second one is where traceroute sometimes reports a timestamp of 0.
- In addition, the firmware now has IPv6 literals for the registrations servers, so an IPv6-only probe can connect to a registration server even if it doesn't have a DNS resolver.

* Thu Jun 21 2012 RIPE Atlas Team <atlas@ripe.net> - 4460
- The main new feature in this firmware is the use of libevent and rewriting the measurement code to use it. This provides a much higher capacity for doing measurements. In addition, the probe now reports results in JSON. Expect the traceroute output to be completely different. The are a number of small changes. For example, the DHCP client now sets the client-id and vendor class. Please note that if you have given the probe a static IPv4 address through DHCP and the probes stops working then this may be caused by the change in DHCP client-id.

* Wed Feb 22 2012 RIPE Atlas Team <atlas@ripe.net> - 4310
- This firmware contains a number of small fixes that deal with exceptional conditions. Probes should also reconnected slightly quicker after a disconnect.

* Mon Oct 10 2011 RIPE Atlas Team <atlas@ripe.net> - 4270
- More pings to fixed destinations
- Traceroutes to fixed destinations
- DNS root server anycast instance checks

* Mon Jul 4 2011 RIPE Atlas Team <atlas@ripe.net> - 4030
- We're in the process of rolling out a new firmware version. It enables a new feature that has been asked by members of the community: /howtos/probe-static-network-config.md. Using the UI, one can ask the probe to try to use static IPv4/IPv6 addresses (and DNS resolvers). If these settings don't work, the probes will fall back to using DHCP. As a byproduct, this feature also allows IPv6-only deployments.

* Mon Feb 7 2011 RIPE Atlas Team <atlas@ripe.net> - 4020
- The new firmware version enables the use of a second registration server (woolsey.atlas.ripe.net). All probes are expected to upgrade automatically in the coming days.
