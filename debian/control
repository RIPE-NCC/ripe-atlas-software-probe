Description: RIPE Atlas essential components
 RIPE Atlas is the RIPE NCC's main Internet data collection system.
 It is a global network of devices, called probes and anchors, that
 actively measure Internet connectivity. Anyone can access this
 data via Internet traffic maps, streaming data visualisations, and
 an API. RIPE Atlas users can also perform customised measurements
 to gain valuable data about their own networks.
 .
 This package contains essential core assets used in all probe
 flavours. It must be installed for a probe to operate as expected.
